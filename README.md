# Negros-Oriental-High-School-Senior-high-School-Registration-System-

System of our thesis research project
Well done for this.... I really didn't realize that many things happen on this system or online registration system that I am creating and also my teammates. Well, this is very impossible to make because of a lack of knowledge about programming language and also the only database.... Well, I am only a self-study as a web developer. Our school doesn't have Comprog/computer language in our senior high school, but this is the best thing that has happened to me because I can showcase my experience creating a system. But the thought that many things have problems, like the security, LRN, and students being illiterate... Well, this is the best as a leader of this research project that I made with my very own hands and also my teammates. And nice work for us, even though our system is "Decline!!" But it's worth the try for this, even though we have knowledge about programming language and also web development. FOR MY PORTFOLIO OF OUR SYSTEM!!!
